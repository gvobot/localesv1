Welcome to the Good Vibes Only (GVO) Bot Language Repository! This repository is dedicated to managing and organizing language translations for our Discord bot, "Good Vibes Only." We use Crowdin, a collaborative localization platform, to facilitate the translation process and ensure that our bot can spread positivity to users from around the world.

## About the Bot

The Good Vibes Only (GVO) bot aims to provide an enhanced and interactive experience for users on Discord servers. To make the bot accessible to a wider audience, we are actively working on translating its content into multiple languages. This repository serves as the central hub for these translations.

## Getting Involved

We welcome and encourage contributions from the community to help us translate the GVO bot's content into different languages. Here's how you can get involved:

### 1. Crowdin

We utilize Crowdin to manage the translation process. Crowdin provides an intuitive and collaborative environment for translators to work together. To contribute, follow these steps:

- Join our Crowdin project using [translate.gvobot.app](https://translate.gvobot.app/).
- Choose the language you're proficient in and start translating the strings.
- If your language isn't listed, please let us know so we can consider adding it.

### 2. Translating Strings

When translating strings, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Maintain the context and tone of the original content as closely as possible.
- Be mindful of character limits, as some strings might have limited space for translation.
- If you encounter any technical terms or phrases specific to the GVO bot, please ensure accurate translation or provide appropriate explanations.

### 3. Review and Approval

All translations submitted through Crowdin will be reviewed by our team before being integrated into the bot. This step ensures the quality and accuracy of translations.

## Adding a New Language

If you'd like to add a new language to the GVO bot, please follow these steps:

1. Contact us or open an issue in this repository to request the addition of the new language.
2. Once approved, we'll add the language to the Crowdin project.
3. You can then start translating the strings for the new language.

## Issues and Questions

If you encounter any issues, have questions about specific translations, or need assistance, please feel free to:

- Open an issue in this repository.
- [Join our Discord server](https://gvobot.app/discord) to discuss with the community.

## Attribution

We greatly appreciate the efforts of all contributors who help make the Good Vibes Only (GVO) bot accessible to a wider audience through translation. Your contributions will be acknowledged both in the bot itself (where feasible) and in this repository.

Thank you for your support and dedication to spreading good vibes to users around the world!
